# Semantic Search Demonstration

This is a repository which contains my own implementation of semantic search on example texts using the model available from 
[NLPL Word Vectors Repository.](http://vectors.nlpl.eu/repository/) version 2.0, published on Friday, December 27, 2019.
Please see the file 'meta.json' in this archive and the overall repository metadata file http://vectors.nlpl.eu/repository/20.json for additional information. 
The life-time identifier for this model is: http://vectors.nlpl.eu/repository/20/0.zip

The used text files are taken from [learn English website of the British Council.](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/skills/reading/c1-reading)
